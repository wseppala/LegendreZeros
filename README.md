# LegendreZeros

This repository contains MATLAB-code for a numerical scheme developed to compute the $k$-zeros of the special case of the associated Legendre function $P_{-1/2 + ik}^m(x)$, 
with $k$ real, $m$ integral and $x$ real exceeding one (aka. the Mehler or conical function).

This work has been made as part of a research project at the Aalto University [Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis](http://math.aalto.fi/en/) and 
my B.Sc. Thesis "Legendren liittofunktion nollakohdat", translating to "Zeros of the associated Legendre function".
* NOTE: Link to the B.Sc. Thesis will be added later.

The method uses only MATLAB files, but the open source MATLAB package Chebfun is required for proper use of the code, 
ie. the package needs to be installed and added to the MATLAB PATH. Chebfun is available for free [here](https://www.chebfun.org/) 
and the documentation can be found [here](https://www.chebfun.org/docs/).
